        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4">How It Works</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Task Manager works by allowing users to add and manage tasks within a simple interface. The tasks you add
            are stored in your browser's local storage,
            ensuring that your tasks remain intact even if you close your browser or refresh the page.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The app provides an intuitive design with options to add new tasks, delete tasks, and track what needs to be
            done, all while maintaining a clean and minimalist look.
