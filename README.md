# Task Manager

Task Manager is a simple web application that allows you to create, manage, and track your tasks. It stores tasks locally in the browser using `localStorage`, ensuring that your tasks remain persistent across page reloads and even after closing the browser.

## Features

- **Create and manage tasks**: Add, edit, and delete tasks easily.
- **Persistent storage**: Tasks are stored in `localStorage` and persist even after closing the browser or refreshing the page.
- **Responsive design**: Fully responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile screens.
- **Simple and intuitive UI**: Minimalist interface with a focus on productivity.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the basic structure of the pages.
- **CSS (TailwindCSS)**: For styling the application with a clean, responsive, and modern design.
- **JavaScript**: For task management functionality, including adding, deleting, and saving tasks to `localStorage`.
- **localStorage**: For persistent storage of tasks in the browser.


## Setup Instructions

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kthlzr/task-manager.git

2. Open the project
Open the index.html file in a browser of your choice to start using the Task Manager app.

3. Modify the components
You can modify the HTML files in the components/ folder to customize or extend the app. The app is modular, so each page can be adjusted independently.

4. Browser Compatibility
This app uses localStorage to store tasks in the browser, which is supported in most modern browsers. Ensure you're using a browser that supports HTML5 and localStorage.

## How To Use
1. **Add a Task**: Enter a task in the input field on the home page and click the "Add Task" button.
2. **Delete a Tas**k: Click the "Delete" button next to any task to remove it from the list.
3. **Tasks Persist**: Your tasks will remain even after you refresh the page or close the browser, thanks to localStorage.
4. **View About Page**: Navigate to the About page to learn more about the app, its features, and how it works.
